&nbsp;**TensorFlow Basics Demonstration**



\### \*\*Aim\*\*



To understand the fundamentals of TensorFlow by creating and manipulating tensors of different ranks, shapes, and sizes, and to explore basic tensor operations using Python.



---



\### \*\*Short Description\*\*



This project introduces the core concepts of TensorFlow by:



\* Installing and importing the TensorFlow library.

\* Creating constants in the form of scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional tensors.

\* Understanding key tensor properties like \*\*shape\*\*, \*\*rank\*\*, and \*\*size\*\*.

\* Generating random tensors with specified shapes and value ranges.

\* Performing simple tensor manipulations for educational purposes.



It serves as a beginner-friendly demonstration of how TensorFlow structures and handles data in a deep learning workflow.

\### \*\*About the Result\*\*



\* The code first prints different types of tensors (scalar, vector, matrix, and 3D tensor) along with their values.

\* It displays the \*\*shape\*\* (dimensions), \*\*rank\*\* (number of dimensions), and \*\*size\*\* (total number of elements) of a tensor.

\* Random tensors are generated to show how TensorFlow can create data for experiments or initialization in machine learning models.

\* The outputs clearly show the differences between various tensor ranks and their structural representations, helping beginners visualize how data is organized in TensorFlow.
